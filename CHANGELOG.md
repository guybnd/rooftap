# Changelog

Rooftap's notable changes, newest first. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org): a minor version for new features, a patch version for fixes.

The Android app also gets over-the-air updates between releases, so a release is cut when the app needs a new APK (new native code) or at a milestone. Each release and its APK are on the public repository's Releases page.

Add a line under **Unreleased** for each change people would notice. Credit outside contributors with their GitHub handle.

## Unreleased

- Self-hosted upgrades back up the database before applying new migrations, and a failed migration is rolled back instead of left half done. `scripts/restore-backup.sh` undoes an upgrade.
- The app hides features a self-hosted server is too old for, and Settings > Modules says what updating the server would add.
- The home-screen widget draws at the launcher's exact size. Needs the next APK.
- Hold a tab to choose its slot in the tab bar. More lists every section.
- Recipes no longer crash on a cached recipe that has no name.

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-20)

- First public release, under the new name Rooftap, with the spectrum roof icon.
- Self-hosting with Docker Compose. See the README.
